= Get Started with SQL Over Files
:description: In this tutorial, you learn the basics of querying files in SQL by creating and querying a CSV file.

{description}

== Before You Begin

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

|Prerequisites|Useful resources

|A Hazelcast cluster in client/server mode and an instance of Management Center running on your local network.

|A connection to the SQL shell

== Step 1. Create a Data Source to Query

SQL can query data in maps, Kafka topics and the local cluster's file system.

In this step, you create a CSV file that you can use to query.

. Create a file named `likes.csv`.

. Add the following data to your file.
+
[source,shell]
----
id,name,likes
1,Jerry,13
2,Greg,108
3,Mary,73
4,Jerry,88
----
+
This example file contains a record of the number of likes each person has.

== Step 2. Create a Mapping to the File

To allow Hazelcast to find and recognize the data in your CSV file, you need to create a mapping to it.

In the SQL shell, use the xref:sql:create-mapping.adoc[`CREATE MAPPING` statement] to configure the file connector and give Hazelcast access to the data in the `likes.csv` file.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING csv_likes (id INT, name VARCHAR, likes INT)
TYPE File
OPTIONS ('format'='csv',
    'path'='/absolute/path/to/current/directory', 'glob'='likes.csv');
----

TIP: Make sure you replace the `path` option with the absolute path to your CSV file.

== Step 3. Run Ad-Hoc Queries

Ad-hoc queries allow you to retrieve a small subset of data. Usually these queries are simple and you can have many of them running concurrently in a Hazelcast cluster.

. Use a xref:sql:select.adoc[`SELECT` statement] to query all the data in the `likes.csv` file.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM csv_likes;
----
+
You should see the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|          id|name                |       likes|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|           1|Jerry               |          13|
|           2|Greg                |         108|
|           3|Mary                |          73|
|           4|Jerry               |          88|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
----

. Query only the `name` and `likes` columns, by adding them as a comma-separated list after the `SELECT` statement.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, likes FROM csv_likes;
----
+
```
+--------------------+------------+
|name                |       likes|
+--------------------+------------+
|Jerry               |          13|
|Greg                |         108|
|Mary                |          73|
|Jerry               |          88|
+--------------------+------------+
```

. Use a filter to display only the names of people with more than 20 likes.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name FROM csv_likes WHERE likes > 20;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|name                |
+--------------------+
|Greg                |
|Mary                |
|Jerry               |
+--------------------+
```

. Give the `name` column an alias for the query results.
+
NOTE: This clause does not rename the column in the table.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name AS popular_users, likes
FROM csv_likes
WHERE likes > 20;
----
+
```
+--------------------+------------+
|popular_users       |       likes|
+--------------------+------------+
|Greg                |         108|
|Mary                |          73|
|Jerry               |          88|
+--------------------+------------+
```

. To filter rows on more than one condition, you can join conditions with the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM csv_likes
WHERE likes > 20 AND name = 'Mary';
----
+
```
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|          id|name                |       likes|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
|           3|Mary                |          73|
+------------+--------------------+------------+
```

. Use the `SUM()` function to aggregate the total number of likes for each person and group the results by name.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name, sum(likes) AS total_likes FROM csv_likes GROUP BY name;
----
+  
You should see the following:
+
```
+--------------------+--------------------+
|name                |         total_likes|
+--------------------+--------------------+
|Greg                |                 108|
|Jerry               |                 101|
|Mary                |                  73|
+--------------------+--------------------+
```
+
The results do not include a row for each Jerry because the `GROUP BY` statement groups the results by name.

. Filter for the names that have more than 100 likes combined, using the `HAVING` clause. This clause is equivalent to the `WHERE` clause but for aggregate groups.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name AS most_liked
FROM csv_likes
GROUP BY name HAVING SUM(likes) > 100;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|most_liked          |
+--------------------+
|Jerry               |
|Greg                |
+--------------------+
```

== Step 4. Run Federated Queries

Federated queries are those that join tables from different datasets.

Normally, querying in SQL is database or dataset-specific. However, Hazelcast, you can pull information from different sources and present a more complete picture of the data.

. Configure the map connector to create a new table called `dislikes`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING dislikes (
__key INT,
name VARCHAR,
dislikes INT
) TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat'='json-flat');
----
+
This table is mapped to a distributed map in Hazelcast where the key is an integer and the value is an object that's serialized to JSON.

. Use `SINK INTO` statements to add some entries to the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO dislikes VALUES
(1, 'Greg', 1),
(2, 'Jerry', 0),
(3, 'Mary', 5),
(4, 'Jerry', 0);
----

. Use the xref:sql:select.adoc#join-tables[`JOIN` clause] to merge results from the `likes` and `dislikes` tables so you can see who has the most likes and dislikes.
+
NOTE: The data source on the right of the join must always be a map.
+
[source,sql]
---- 
SELECT csv_likes.name, csv_likes.likes, dislikes.dislikes
FROM csv_likes
JOIN dislikes
ON csv_likes.id = dislikes.__key;
----
+
```
+--------------------+------------+------------+
|name                |       likes|    dislikes|
+--------------------+------------+------------+
|Jerry               |          13|           0|
|Greg                |         108|           5|
|Mary                |          73|           5|
|Jerry               |          88|          20|
+--------------------+------------+------------+
```

. Use the `ORDER BY` clause to order the results by name and use the `LIMIT` clause to limit them so that only the first two are displayed.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT csv_likes.name, csv_likes.likes, dislikes.dislikes
FROM csv_likes
JOIN dislikes
ON csv_likes.id = dislikes.__key
ORDER BY csv_likes.name
LIMIT 2;
----

== Step 5. Ingest Query Results into a Hazelcast Map

To save your query results as a view, you can cache them in Hazelcast by ingesting them into a map.

. Configure the map connector to create a new table called `likes_and_dislikes`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING likes_and_dislikes (
__key INT,
name VARCHAR,
likes INT,
dislikes INT
) TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat'='json-flat');
----
+
This table is mapped to a distributed map in Hazelcast where the key is an integer and the value is an object that's serialized to JSON.

. Run the `JOIN` query to merge results from the CSV file and the `dislikes` map and insert them into the `likes_and_dislikes` map.
+
[source,sql]
---- 
INSERT INTO likes_and_dislikes SELECT dislikes.__key, csv_likes.name, csv_likes.likes, dislikes.dislikes
FROM csv_likes
JOIN dislikes
ON csv_likes.id = dislikes.__key;
----

. Make sure that the query results were added to the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM likes_and_dislikes;
----
+
```
+------------+----------+------------+------------+
|       __key|name      |       likes|    dislikes|
+------------+----------+------------+------------+
|           2|Greg      |         108|           0|
|           1|Jerry     |          13|           1|
|           4|Jerry     |          88|           0|
|           3|Mary      |          73|           5|
+------------+----------+------------+------------+
```
